      <description>About me Since 2015 I have learnt a lot about Data Science, Programming, Data Engineering in my free time. Now I try to collect my knowledge as posts, as reminders for myself. I know some R, Python, SQL. I use Fedora everyday for several years. With my friends - Google, Stackoverflow - I can troubleshoot a lot of things. I am an Environmental Engineer and have PhD in Chemistry.
During my learning journey I attended several courses and used a lot of platforms.</description>
