      <description>My mini rpg project This is a fun project to practice OOP in Python. The main idea is from FutureLearn.
Aim of this game to get 3 friends, most of the time you have to fight with them to become friendly. Possible commands to move the player from room to room are north, south, west, east. Other commands talk, fight, check, backpack.
Commands (after &amp;gt; sign):
 north, south, west, east talk fight check backback  </description>

      <description>About me Since 2015 I have learnt a lot about Data Science, Programming, Data Engineering in my free time. Now I try to collect my knowledge as posts, as reminders for myself. I know some R, Python, SQL. I use Fedora everyday for several years. With my friends - Google, Stackoverflow - I can troubleshoot a lot of things. I am an Environmental Engineer and have PhD in Chemistry.
During my learning journey I attended several courses and used a lot of platforms.</description>
